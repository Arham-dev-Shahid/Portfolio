 <h5>I’m a 16-year-old freelance developer who’s already stepping<br/> 
    into the world of tech—with passion, purpose, and React by my 
    side.</h5>

<h5>Yes, I’m a beginner. But being new doesn’t mean being weak—it 
    means<br/> I’m growing fast, learning daily, and doing what many 
    only think about.<br/> I’ve already started building real projects 
    with React<br/> and working with real people, and this 
    experience <span className="Begineer-span">is just the beginning.</span></h5>

<h5>I believe in taking action. I didn’t wait to be “ready”<br/>I 
    decided to start, and that’s made all the difference.</h5>
<h5>
I’m focused, creative, and not afraid to take on challenges.<br/> I build 
modern web interfaces using React and aim to keep leveling up<br/> with 
every project I touch.
